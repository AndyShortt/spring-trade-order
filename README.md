# spring-trade-order
A simple application built in Spring Boot to ingest equity trade orders and log them in DynamoDB.

This is not production code, use it at your own risk. It is intended for POC reasons only.

I used https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/ to get started and then modified it to meet the purpose.
